# Guidelines for the Team Ball Action Spotting challenge

Here we present the 3rd [Ball Action Spotting Challenge](). Subscribe (watch) the repo to receive the latest info regarding timeline and prizes!

We propose the SoccerNet challenge to encourage the development of state-of-the-art algorithm for Generic Soccer Video Understanding.
 - **Ball Action Spotting**: Spot the actions related to the ball on a complete video of soccer game among 12 classes. In this third edition, methods are additionally required to identify the team performing the action (left or right).

We provide evaluation servers for the team ball action spotting task. The evaluation server handles predictions for the open [**test**](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4418/) sets and the segregated [**challenge**](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4417/) sets.

Winners will tentatively be announced at the CVSports Workshop at CVPR 2025.
Prizes will be revealed soon, stay tuned!
