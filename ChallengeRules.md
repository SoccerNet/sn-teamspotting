Subscribe (watch) the repo to receive the latest info regarding timeline and prizes!

We propose the SoccerNet challenge to encourage the development of state-of-the-art algorithm for Generic Soccer Video Understanding.
 - **Ball Action Spotting**: Spot the actions related to the ball on a complete video of soccer game among 12 classes. In this third edition, methods are additionally required to identify the team performing the action (left or right).

We provide evaluation servers for the team ball action spotting task. The evaluation server handles predictions for the open [**test**](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4233/?secret_key=3943fc23-a8de-4e4f-a073-a1f25ac75b2c) sets and the segregated [**challenge**](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4234/?secret_key=9569c83f-f910-4f28-bac6-f811a250befd) sets.
